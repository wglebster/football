So, I just finished my Data Analytics course with CodeClan. This project
is purely for educational purposes to help me keep my Data skills fresh.

*Temporarily on hold, as I was contacted by Path for All - the charity that I worked with on my final Project (private repo). They asked me to do some extra work on their data.
